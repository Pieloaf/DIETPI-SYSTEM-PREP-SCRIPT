# WARNING: 
This script is based on DIETPI v7.5. DietPi master is currently on v8.12. After DIETPI v8.4 the PREP_SYSTEM_FOR_DIETPI.sh script was repalced with a new installer script. I have just updated the github URL to the latest image, use at your own risk.

## Install Dietpi for Ionos/vm
 
Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install DietPi for ionos/vm using the following commands:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pieloaf/Debian-DietPi-Install-Script/main/debian-dietpi-install.sh`

`chmod +x debian-dietpi-install.sh`

`./debian-dietpi-install.sh`

Optimise current Debian install and prepare DietPi installation for ionos/vm servers
Script is made to work for Debian installs on ionos/vm servers but relies heavily on the premade installer from DietPi itself:
