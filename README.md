## Install Dietpi for ionos/vm

Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install DietPi for ionos/vm using the following commands:

### `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pieloaf/Debian-DietPi-Install-Script/main/debian-dietpi-install.sh`
### `chmod +x debian-dietpi-install.sh`
### `./debian-dietpi-install.sh`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimise current Debian install and prepare DietPi installation for ionos/vm servers
Script is made to work for Debian installs on ionos/vm servers but relies heavily on the premade installer from DietPi itself:

Creds to [Dreez](https://github.com/davbauer) for the idea and working on it with me.
